1 - ESPEAK

Make sure to add "espeak\command_line" to your PATH environment variable, espeak is a speech synthesis API I use
for when to do a repition and when to contract.

2 -  THE ".NEWAGE" FILE

Your .newage file is the heart and soul of your NewAge, it contains all the exercises
you'll ever perform in a session with their respective settings.

Your .newage file needs 3 primary ingredients to work properly, Specifiers, Categories and Exercises.

Let's go over what those things are and how to set them up.

2.1 - SPECIFIERS

Specifiers are basically just values, they're values that have different purposes and are interepreted in a certain way by
your NewAge, an example of these specifiers is the 'ROUNDS' specifier, this specifier holds the amount of rounds you'll be
performing in an exercise session, here's how specifiers are generally defined.

{Syntax}

// Fig 1
#[type of specifier] [name of specifier] [value of specifier]

{Example}

// Fig 2
#INT    ROUNDS     3
[type]  [name]     [value]

Note: Specifiers should always be at the top of your .newage file

2.2 - CATEGORIES

Think of categories as boxes that store your exercises, they are absolutely essential and without them your NewAge wouldn't register
any exercises at all.

You need 2 things to instantiate a category, the category itself and the specifier that points to the category you want (this implies that you can have
multiple categories for different types of exercises)

Here's how to define a category:

{Syntax}

// Fig 3
%[name of category]

{Example}

// Fig 4
%MY_EXERCISES

Now defining a category alone won't get NewAge to compile all the exercises in that category, you need to actually point to which
category you would like to use. To do this you need to use the 'CATEGORY' specifier.

========================================
#CHAR CATEGORY   MY_EXERCISES

%MY_EXERCISES
========================================

2.3 - EXERCISES

An exercise in the NewAge conceptual universe is an object that has 6 or more values, those values are the following:

1 - The name of the exercise
2 - Whether or not the exercise is a freestyle exercise (True or False boolean)
3 - The amount of sets for that exercise
4 - The amount of reps for that exercise
5 - The amount of seconds you have to hold that rep
6 - The amount of seconds you're allowed to contract for (alternation)
7+ - Additional and optional info that you'll rarely ever use

{Syntax}

// Fig 5

$[name of exercise]    [sets] [freestyle] [reps] [hold] [alternate hold] [additional/optional info]

{Example}

$Glute_Bridge  1 F 15 10 3


Note: Use underscores instead of spaces when writing the names of your exercises, otherwise your NewAge won't work as intended

2.4 FINAL PICTURE

Here's how a bare minimum .newage file looks like

========================================
#INT ROUNDS       1
#CHAR CATEGORY    MY_EXERCISES

%MY_EXERCISES

$Glute_Bridge           1 F 15 10 3
$Some_Other_Exercise    1 F 12 20 5
========================================

Now that you have the bare minimum set up, running your NewAge should get you something that looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/rzO9dQJ
